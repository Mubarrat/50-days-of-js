# JavaScript String Methods Lab

In this lab, you will practice using JavaScript string methods by implementing four different functions that manipulate and analyze strings. Use ESM syntax to create and export the functions from your `index.js` file. Work directly within the provided boilerplates to complete the challenges!

> Make sure to export all the 4 functions that you've created in this lab
