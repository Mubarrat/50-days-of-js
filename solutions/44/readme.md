# JavaScript Promise Chaining Lab

In this lab, you will practice using JavaScript Promises in a chain format. You will create two functions - `fetchData` and `processData`.

The `fetchData` function will simulate fetching data using a Promise and do so with a 1-second delay.

The `processData` function will take this data and process it, once again delaying this operation by 1 second using a Promise.

Your task is to implement the `fetchData` and `processData` functions and export the functions correctly and chain them together to produce the final output.
