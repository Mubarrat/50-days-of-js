# Inheritance in JavaScript

In this lab, you are going to apply the concept of inheritance by creating classes and their relationship in JavaScript. First, you will create a **Person** class with properties 'firstName' and 'lastName'. Then, create a method 'fullName()' that returns the full name of the person.

After that, create another class **Employee** that inherits from the **Person** class. Add new properties 'position' and 'salary' to this derived class. Finally, create a 'toString()' method that returns the string representation of the Employee object.
