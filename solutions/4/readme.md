# Random in range

In this coding challenge, you will be implementing a function called `randomInRange(min, max)` that generates a random integer between a given minimum value (inclusive) and a maximum value (exclusive). The function should take two arguments, `min` and `max`, both of which are integers.

## Instructions

*   The minimum value is `inclusive` and the maximum value is `exclusive`.
*   Assume that this statement is always true `min < max.`

## Example test cases

```javascript
const randomInt = randomInRange(1, 10);
console.log(randomInt); // output: a random integer between 1 and 9
```
