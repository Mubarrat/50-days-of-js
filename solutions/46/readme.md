# JavaScript Generators Lab

In this lab, you'll be learning about JavaScript generator functions. A generator function is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed, allowing for greater control over the execution of the function. You'll be creating a generator function that counts upwards from 1 up to a given limit, and you'll iterate over that generator to print the values. With this lab, you'll gain a better understanding of how to create and use generator functions in JavaScript.

If you've never heard of Generators, go through the [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator) to understand the basic usage of Generators

> Make sure to export the function using ESM syntax, the export function will be used for running the tests
