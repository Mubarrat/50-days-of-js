# String indexOf Lab

In this lab exercise, you will be working with the `String.prototype.indexOf()` method to find the index of a substring inside a given string. The `indexOf()` method returns the first index at which a given substring is found or `-1` if it is not present.

Your task is to create a custom `findSubstringIndex` function that accepts two parameters (a text string and a substring to be found) and returns the index of the substring in the text using the `indexOf` method.

Keep in mind that the function should also check if the input strings are empty and return `-1` if empty. Default export the function using ESM syntax for the test cases to verify your code
