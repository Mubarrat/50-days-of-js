# Handling JavaScript Errors

In this lab, you will learn how to handle errors in JavaScript using try-catch blocks. You will create and throw a custom error, and then catch and log the errors properly.

Try-catch blocks are an important part of writing robust JavaScript code by allowing us to gracefully handle errors and prevent our application from crashing or freezing.

A try block will contain the code we want to execute, and the catch block will catch any errors. If an error is caught, you can log it or handle it in any way you want.
