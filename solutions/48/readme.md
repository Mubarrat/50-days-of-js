# JavaScript Function Methods

In this lab, you will learn about JavaScript function methods. You will create two functions, `addNumbers` and `multiplyNumbers`, to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication. You will also learn how to export functions as named and default exports.

**Prerequisites:** Basic knowledge of JavaScript functions and ESM (ECMAScript modules).

Let's get started by creating the `addNumbers` and `multiplyNumbers` functions!

Make sure you export the `addNumbers` function and default export the `multipleNumbers`
