# Using spread operator in function parameter

In this lab, you will create a JavaScript function called `sum` that uses the spread operator when defining the paramemter `args` to accept any number of arguments and calculates their sum. The function should be exported for testing purposes.

[JavaScript's spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) (`...`) allows you to expand iterable elements like arrays or strings. It's useful when you want to collect any number of arguments passed to a function or when you want to spread elements among different arrays or objects.
