# Reverse a string

You have been asked to write a function `reverseAString(str)` that takes in a string `str` as an argument. The function should return a new string that is the reverse of the input string.

### Instructions

*   If the input string is empty, then return an empty string.
*   The output should always be the argument string in reverse order.

### Example test cases

```javascript
reverseAString("hello") // Output: "olleh"
reverseAString("hi") // Output: "ih"
reverseAString("gfedcba") // Output: "abcdefg"
```

### Hints

*   You can chain multiple built-in methods.
*   Strings are immutable, so return a new string.
